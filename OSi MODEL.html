    <h1>What is OSI MODEL</h1>
    <p>
        OSI stands for open system interconnection model it has been developed by International standard organization
        (ISO) in 1984.<br>It is a 7 layers Architecture Where each layer specific funtionally. All these 7 layer work 
        Collaborality to transmit the data from <br>one network to another network across the globe.
    </p><br>
    <h1>7 Layers Of OSI MODEL</h1>
    <h1>01: Physical Layer</h1>
    <p>
        In This Layer Data is converted into electrical signals(0 and 1) or light pulses and sent over wires, fiber optics, or through wireless signals
    </p>
    <h1>02: Data Link Layer</h1>
    <p>
        This layer is responsible to transmit data using physical
        addresses. Data Link Layer ensures error free 
        transmission of packets.
    </p>
    <h1>03: Network Layer</h1>
    <p>
        The function of this layer is the selection of the shortest
        and suitable path from source to destination from the
        number of routes available.
    </p>
    <h1>04: Transport Layer</h1>
    <p>
        This layer makes sure the data is broken into smaller pieces (so itâ€™s easier to send) and it ensures that all the pieces arrive correctly.
    </p>
    <h1>05: Session Layer</h1>
    <p>
        It opens, manages, and closes communication sessions between devices.
    </p>
    <h1>06: Presentation Layer</h1>
    <p>
        This layer translates data into a format the receiving device can understand. It also encrypts and compresses data if needed.
    </p>
    <h1>07: Application Layer</h1>
    <p>
        Where users and applications interact with the network.
